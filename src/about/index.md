<h1 class="text-heading-2">About me</h1>

I’m passionate about creating digital products that make sense for both users and teams. Over 5+ years, I’ve helped turn ideas into interfaces that are practical, reliable, and clear. I value collaboration, structured workflows, and thoughtful design decisions that have a real impact.

## <u>Favourite kinds of projects</u>

I enjoy projects where design meets real-world needs. My favorite kinds of projects include:

* **Data-rich dashboards & complex platforms**: projects that involve structuring large volumes of data and turning complexity into clear, readable interfaces. I have a special interest in products with multiple user roles and permissions.
* **Creative interfaces with non-standard layouts**: web and mobile interfaces where there’s room to explore alternative concepts, experiment with layouts, and find visual solutions beyond typical patterns.
* **Products built from scratch and thoughtful redesigns**: I enjoy working both on new products and redesigns, especially when there’s freedom to propose and compare multiple design directions before shaping the final solution.
* **Design systems as a shared language**: projects where consistency matters, using design systems not only to scale interfaces, but also to align teams and create a coherent experience for final users.
