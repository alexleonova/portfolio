## Overview

Inhabify is a platform offering property management solutions that allow users to create customized services for their tenants, helping to increase revenue and customer retention. The company focuses on providing curated living experiences through its innovative solutions.

## Problem

Inhabify needed a distinctive logo that could be used across various media platforms, including their website, app, billboards, and printed materials. The challenge was to create a unique and memorable logo that accurately reflected the company’s mission and values.

## Solution

I designed a versatile logo for Inhabify, provided in multiple formats (EPS, PNG, TIFF) and accompanied by a comprehensive guideline detailing its usage across different media.

\[DEMO]

## Design Process

1. ### Brief:

   I began by familiarizing myself with the project’s basic information, goals, and client requirements. This initial step was crucial for aligning the design with Inhabify’s vision and objectives.
2. ### Research & Analysis:

   Collaborating with a marketing expert, I studied Inhabify’s competitors and their branding strategies. We analyzed visual trends in the property management industry and outlined Inhabify’s positioning, mission, values, and priorities. Understanding the target audience was essential to ensure the logo made the right impression.
3. ### Conceptualization:

   Based on our research, I brainstormed and verbalized potential brand images. The main objective was to create a logo that embodies the essence of Inhabify and resonates with its audience. I formed visual concepts that represented the company's identity and values.
4. ### Creating an Outline:

   I sketched eight logo concepts by hand, each reflecting different facets of the brand identity. These sketches were shared with the client to select the top 3–4 options for further development.
5. ### Finalization of Versions:

   Using Adobe Illustrator, I transformed the selected sketches into digital formats, adding details and selecting appropriate colors and elements. Client discussions helped refine these designs to align perfectly with their expectations.
6. ### Final Presentation:

   I created presentation versions of the logo, showcasing its application across various media like websites, products, documents, and promotional materials. After discussions with the client, we finalized the logo design.
7. ### Preparing for Launch:

   I developed a guideline document that included instructions for logo usage, color options, simplified versions for lower resolutions, and positioning options. The final logo and guidelines were delivered to the client in various formats.

## Challenges

The primary challenge was diving into an ongoing project and quickly understanding the overall platform and website to create a logo that integrated seamlessly with the existing design.

## Result

Inhabify received a distinctive and versatile logo that effectively communicates their brand identity and values. The logo is easily recognizable and reinforces the company's image as a reliable and innovative property management solution provider.
