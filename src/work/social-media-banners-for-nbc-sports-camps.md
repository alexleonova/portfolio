## Overview

NBC Camps provides training camps for basketball, volleyball, lacrosse, and fine arts, focusing on athletic skill development and personal growth, including leadership and resilience.

## Problem

NBC Camps needed to attract attention to their basketball and volleyball camps, increase registrations, and enhance the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns with professionally created visuals and text for Facebook and Instagram ads.

## Solution

I designed a series of eye-catching social media banners for Facebook and Instagram, targeting parents planning their children's leisure activities. These materials aimed to boost camp registrations and reinforce NBC Camps’ brand identity.

## Design Process

1. ### Research & Analysis:

   I started by defining the goals for the creatives, ensuring they complemented the ad content and were visually appealing. I analyzed the target audience and researched similar themes, selecting relevant design references. Collaborating with the copywriter and marketer helped refine the content for the creatives.
2. ### Visual Design:

   I developed five alternative design concepts for basketball camps. I selected color schemes, typography, and style solutions based on general design principles, research, and client preferences. Adapting the client's photos to fit the visual style was a crucial part of this process.
3. ### Interaction with the Marketing Team:

   I discussed the design concepts with the marketing team, finalizing the designs and content. We selected four main solutions, which were then sent to the client for approval. Only minimal edits were required, ensuring the designs met all specifications.
4. ### Creation of Creatives for All Activities:

   I developed banners for volleyball camps using the approved design solutions. These were finalized with input from marketers and the client, ensuring consistency across all target audiences.
5. ### Preparing the Creatives for Launch:

   I adapted the selected designs for different formats, including 1:1 and 9:16 ratios, and handed over the final creatives for the advertising campaigns.

## Challenges

A significant challenge was creating cohesive designs that aligned with NBC Camps’ brand while being versatile enough to attract various target audiences. Flexibility and iterative feedback were key to overcoming these challenges.

## Result

The campaign successfully launched multi-platform ads, increasing NBC Camps’ brand awareness and engagement. The visually appealing banners attracted attention, generated positive feedback, and boosted camp registrations.
