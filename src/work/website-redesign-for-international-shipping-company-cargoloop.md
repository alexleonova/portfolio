## Overview:

CargoLoop is a business that provides transportation services for cars, boats, and motorcycles within the USA and European countries. They approached me to redesign their website, as their existing site had outdated and compressed information about their services.

## Problem:

The primary challenge was to create a website that provides detailed information about CargoLoop's services and the company in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. The client wanted a design refresh that would enhance the overall user experience and effectively communicate their offerings.

## Solution:

I was the sole UX/UI designer and motion designer for this project. My responsibilities included:

* Conducting competitive research and design analysis;
* Creating wireframes and prototypes;
* Designing the website's visual elements, including typography, color scheme, and iconography;
* Incorporating animation and micro-interactions throughout the website;
* Collaborating with developers and testers during implementation;
* Performing final design reviews and quality assurance.

## Design Process:

1. ### Research and Analysis:

   I started by researching CargoLoop's competitors and analyzing their website designs. While many competitors had outdated designs, this research helped me understand the industry standards and identify areas for improvement.
2. ### Prototyping:

   Based on the client's requirements and my research, I created low-fidelity prototypes to establish the overall structure and information architecture of the website.
3. ### Visual Design:

   After gaining approval for the prototypes, I focused on the visual design aspects. I followed design principles such as using large typography, incorporating CargoLoop's brand color (orange) as an accent, and emphasizing the use of video and animation throughout the website.
4. ### Animation and Micro-interactions:

   To enhance the user experience, I designed various animations and micro-interactions for different elements, such as headlines and call-to-action buttons.
5. ### Collaboration and Refinement:

   I worked closely with the development team, providing them with detailed documentation, animation references, and guidance. Throughout the implementation phase, I collaborated with the tester to identify and resolve any design-related issues.
6. ### Final Review:

   Once the development was complete, I conducted a thorough design review to ensure the final product met the desired standards and functioned as intended.



## Challenges

The project had tight deadlines, and the client had specific design preferences, requiring multiple iterations before reaching final approval. Additionally, there were some technical limitations that influenced design decisions, such as combining development and motion design for a complex animation block on the main page.

## Result

The redesigned CargoLoop website achieved the desired outcomes, providing detailed information about the company's services and offerings in a modern and dynamic manner. The website features enhanced service pages, an updated company page, a career section for job applications, and a resources section explaining the company's overall logistics.

From my perspective, the project allowed me to further develop my skills in animation and micro-interactions, as well as gain experience in collaborating closely with developers and testers throughout the design implementation process.
