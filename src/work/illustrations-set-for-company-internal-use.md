## Overview

This was an internal project for a full-service digital product agency specializing in concept development, design, web and mobile product development, and digital marketing. Our team developed a blog page and an article titled “Why Your Business Needs to Switch to Google Analytics 4 Today.”

## Problem

The project required developing engaging visual content for the blog article to enhance user understanding and diversify the content on the page.

## Solution

I created a cohesive set of illustrations that complemented the article, visually representing key points and enhancing the overall user experience on the blog page.

\[DEMO]

## Design Process

1. ### Research & Analysis:

   I began by understanding the article's content to visualize the information effectively. Collaborating with the UX/UI designer, I analyzed the site layout and discussed the illustration styles, color palettes, and level of detail to ensure harmony with the page content. I also gathered design references to inspire and guide my illustrations.
2. ### Creating a Sketch (Concept):

   I developed several drafts of one illustration in different styles, including cartoon, sketch, and infographic presentation. These concepts were discussed within the team to determine the direction for the final illustrations, focusing on the style and character of rendering.
3. ### Finalization and Detailing of the Illustration:

   After selecting the most suitable concept, I detailed the illustration, refining the composition and color palette. The final concept was approved by the client, ensuring it aligned with the article’s tone and the website's design.
4. ### Drawing the Illustration Package:

   I created three illustrations for the blog page in the approved style, ensuring consistency across all visual elements. These illustrations were designed to enrich the article’s content and facilitate user understanding.
5. ### Preparation for Placement on the Website:

   I adapted the illustrations for different formats (desktop/responsive, OG-image) and provided the development team with vector (.svg) and bitmap (.png) files. This step ensured the illustrations would display correctly across various devices and screen resolutions.

## Challenges

The primary challenge was quickly understanding the task and the layouts to offer effective illustration concepts. Additionally, balancing detailed and concise visual elements to avoid overloading the page while clearly communicating the article’s key points required careful consideration.

## Result

The blog article went live with a set of illustrations that reflected the content’s train of thought, providing a visually appealing and informative user experience. The illustrations were integrated seamlessly, maintaining a consistent visual style that enhanced the article’s readability.
