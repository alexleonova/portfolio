## Overview:

CreatorsLegal is a digital platform in the legal services sphere, designed to speed up and unify the process of drafting contracts in various fields of activity. The platform provides simple, industry-standard contracts that can be filled out, sent, and signed electronically in minutes.

## Problem:

The client needed to visually represent their business proposition and enhance user understanding of their contract management platform. They required illustrations that were consistent in style and effectively reflected the process of concluding contracts in various industries.

## Solution:

I developed a comprehensive set of 12 illustrations and 10 icons for the main page, industry pages, website, platform, and marketing materials. These visuals were designed to provide clear navigation, visualize complex concepts, and strengthen the brand's visual identity.

\[DEMO]

## Design Process:

1. ### Research and analysis:

   I began by defining the goals for the illustrations, which needed to convey the ease of the contract conclusion process and showcase the industries served. I studied competitor websites, analyzed layout designs with the UX/UI designer, and collected references from resources like Dribbble and Behance to inform my approach.
2. ### Concept Development:

   I created several sketches of one illustration and one icon in different styles (cartoon, sketch, infographic). These concepts were presented to the client to determine the preferred direction for refinement, character, and rendering style. This stage was crucial in aligning my vision with the client's expectations.
3. ### Refinement and Detailing:

   After client approval, I refined the chosen illustration and icon concept. I focused on elaborating composition details and selecting an appropriate color palette. The final concept was then approved by the client, ensuring we were on the right track before proceeding with the full package.
4. ### Full Package Creation:

   Using the approved style, I designed illustrations and icons for the main page, category pages, and platform screens. I ensured consistency across all visuals while adapting to the specific needs of each page or screen.
5. ### Preparation and Handoff:

   I adapted the illustrations for various formats (desktop/responsive, Open Graph images) and prepared them for website integration. The final step involved transferring the illustrations to the development team in both vector and raster formats, ensuring they had all necessary assets for implementation.

## Challenges:

* Quickly grasping the project essence and proposing illustration concepts at the UI design stage
* Adapting the color palette to harmonize with changing website and platform designs
* Balancing detail and simplicity in illustrations to effectively communicate complex concepts
* Maintaining consistency across a large set of illustrations and icons

## Conclusion:

The illustrations and icons provided clear visual navigation, helping users understand the platform's functionalities and enhancing overall usability. The consistent visual style strengthened the brand's identity, making it more memorable and attractive. The client appreciated the team's clear communication and quick execution, leading to positive feedback and recommendations. This project not only improved the functionality and visual appeal of Creators Legal's platform but also provided a valuable addition to our company's portfolio, showcasing our ability to deliver comprehensive visual solutions for complex digital products.
