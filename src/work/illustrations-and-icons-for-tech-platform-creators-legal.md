## Overview:

CreatorsLegal is a digital platform in the legal services sphere, designed to speed up and unify the process of drafting contracts in various fields of activity. The platform provides simple, industry-standard contracts that can be filled out, sent, and signed electronically in minutes.

## Problem:

The client needed to decide how to organize their business proposal. My company was involved in designing and developing solutions, as well as providing expert consultations on business growth.

I was solving the issue of visual content on the website and platform. The illustrations had to be consistent in style and reflect the company's activities (the process of concluding contracts in various spheres/industries).

## Solution:

As a digital illustrator and 2D artist, I was brought in to create visual content that would:

* Reflect the company's activities across various industries;
* Provide intuitive navigation through the site and platform;
* Visualize complex contract-related concepts and processes;
* Maintain a consistent and appealing visual style.

\[DEMO]

## Design Process:

1. ### Research and analysis:

   The goals that the illustrations should solve were defined (conveying to the user the ease of the contract conclusion process through the platform, showing in which fields of activity it is possible to conclude such contracts). Understanding the target audience and its specifics (the illustration should form the impression that the brand wants to make on the external or internal target audience). The research of similar solutions and the selection of design references were conducted.


2. ### Creation of a sketch (concept):

   Several sketches of one illustration and one icon were developed in different styles (cartoon style, sketch, infographic presentation style). Concepts were sent to the client to determine the further vector of refinement, character, and style of rendering.


3. ### Finalization of the illustration:

   Refinement of the chosen illustration and icon concept. Detailing of the illustration and icon (elaboration of composition element details, color palette selection). Approval of the final concept by the client.


4. ### Design of a package of illustrations and icons:

   Illustrations and icons for the main page, category pages, and platform screens were drawn in the approved style.


5. ### Preparation for uploading on the website:

   Adaptation of the illustration for various formats (desktop/responsive, Open Graph images). Transfer of illustrations to the development team in vector and raster formats.



## Result:

* The company developed a contract management platform, as well as a presentation website optimized for marketing and conversion. My team completed the project on time. The client highly appreciated the team's clear and productive communication and quick execution of work.
* The results of our work not only improved the functionality and usability of the platform but also increased its visual appeal and competitiveness in the market. The company's clients can easily and effectively conclude contracts while receiving a positive brand interaction experience.
* I prepared visual content: 12 illustrations and 10 icons for the main page and industry pages where contracts are concluded, for the website, platform, and marketing materials.





## Conclusion:

The CreatorsLegal project showcased the power of thoughtful visual design in simplifying complex processes. By creating intuitive, consistent, and appealing illustrations, we were able to enhance the platform's usability and strengthen the client's brand identity in the competitive legal services market.
