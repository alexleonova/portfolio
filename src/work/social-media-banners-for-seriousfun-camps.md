## Overview

SeriousFun is a global network of 30 camps and programs offering free recreational activities to seriously ill children and their families. These transformative camps, located across North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, help build confidence and resilience in children facing challenging circumstances.

## Problem

SeriousFun needed to leverage digital advertising to attract more campers, recruit volunteers, and increase brand awareness.

## Solution

I designed a series of visually compelling social media banners for Facebook and Instagram, targeting potential campers, volunteers, and medical professionals. These materials aimed to enhance SeriousFun’s online presence and engagement.

## Design Process

1. ### Research & Analysis:

   I started by defining the goals and tasks for the creatives, ensuring they complemented the advertisement content and were eye-catching. I analyzed the target audience, researched similar themes, and selected design references. Collaborating with the copywriter and marketer helped shape the content for the creatives.
2. ### Visual Design:

   I developed six alternative design concepts for the banners, focusing on potential camp participants. I chose color schemes, typography, and style solutions based on research, client preferences, and general design principles. I adapted the client's photos to fit the visual style.
3. ### Interaction with the Marketing Team:

   I discussed the design concepts with marketers, refined the designs and content, and sent them to the client for approval. Only minimal edits were required, ensuring the designs met all specifications.
4. ### Creation of Creatives for All Activities:

   I developed banners for volunteers and medical professionals using the approved design solutions. These were finalized with the marketing team and client, ensuring consistency across all target audiences.
5. ### Preparing the Creatives for Launch:

   I adapted the selected designs for different formats, including 1:1 and 9:16 ratios, and handed over the final creatives for the advertising campaigns.

## Challenges

A significant challenge was creating cohesive designs that aligned with SeriousFun’s brand while being versatile enough to attract various target audiences. Flexibility and iterative feedback were key to overcoming these challenges.

## Result

The campaign successfully launched multi-platform ads on Google and Meta, increasing SeriousFun’s brand awareness and engagement. The visually appealing banners attracted attention, generated positive feedback, and encouraged more registrations from campers, volunteers, and healthcare professionals.
