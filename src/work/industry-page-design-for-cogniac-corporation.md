## Overview:

Cogniac is an enterprise platform leveraging AI to optimize production and efficiency across various industries. As the UX/UI designer, I was tasked with creating a standalone landing page for their government sector services.

## Problem:

While Cogniac had an existing website, they needed a dedicated landing page to showcase their AI solutions specifically for government applications. This page needed to effectively communicate Cogniac's offerings in security and classified operations.

## Solution:

I designed a custom landing page that introduces Cogniac's government-focused services, highlights customer testimonials, and presents industry-specific solutions. The page was designed to be hosted on a separate subdomain, allowing for design flexibility.

\[DEMO]

## Design Process:

1. ### Research and Analysis:

   I began by analyzing Cogniac's current website to identify existing design principles. I then conducted competitor research, focusing on page structures, content organization, and industry-specific design trends. This research helped me determine which elements and information should be prioritized on the new landing page.
2. ### Prototyping:

   Using insights from the research phase, I developed low-fidelity wireframes to establish the page structure and navigation. I focused on creating a logical flow of information that would gradually immerse users in Cogniac's government solutions.
3. ### UI Design:

   I translated the wireframes into high-fidelity prototypes, carefully selecting a color scheme, typography, and visual elements. I maintained consistency with Cogniac's brand while introducing fresh design ideas. I paid special attention to contrast, using a main color palette with contrasting accents to highlight key information.
4. ### Development Handoff:

   I created a comprehensive design system for the page, ensuring consistency and adherence to the grid. I designed interactive elements like buttons and sliders, including their various states. I also prepared responsive layouts for tablet and mobile versions to ensure a seamless experience across devices.

## Challenges:

* Balancing design innovation with brand consistency
* Effectively communicating complex AI solutions for government applications
* Organizing a large amount of content (text and images) in a user-friendly manner

## Result:

The final product was a visually appealing and informative landing page that successfully showcased Cogniac's AI solutions for the government sector. The page effectively communicated the company's expertise in enhancing security across various government operations. The client appreciated the clear communication and quick turnaround time, leading to positive feedback and recommendations. This project allowed me to deepen my skills in content-heavy design and complex page structures, while also exploring innovative design solutions within the constraints of an established brand.
