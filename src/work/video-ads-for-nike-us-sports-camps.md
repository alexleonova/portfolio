## Overview

US Sports Camps (USSC) is a premier organizer of sports camps in the United States and globally, partnering exclusively with Nike for a branded sports camp program. They offer training camps in basketball, volleyball, lacrosse, and other sports, focusing on skill development and personal growth.

## Problem

USSC needed a creative advertising strategy to attract new clients, scale their advertising budgets, and maintain campaign effectiveness. Previously, they were not utilizing Facebook as a platform to boost sales.

## Solution

I created over 20 engaging promotional videos for various sports camps, tailored for Facebook and Instagram ads. These videos aimed to attract attention, increase engagement, and drive camp registrations.

## Design Process

1. ### Research & Analysis:

   I began by defining the goals for the videos, ensuring they complemented the advertisement content and were visually striking. I analyzed the target audience — primarily parents planning their children's leisure activities—and researched similar advertising solutions. Collaborating with the copywriter and marketer helped refine the video content.
2. ### Development of Test Versions:

   I developed three alternative concepts for the final video fragment (~5-10 seconds). This involved selecting typography, creating animation effects, and adapting the client's video materials. I also searched for suitable music and generated voice-overs using ElevenLabs for one concept.
3. ### Interaction with the Marketing Team:

   I discussed the design concepts with the marketing team and finalized the motion design and content. We selected two main solutions, which were then sent to the client for approval. Minimal edits were made, ensuring the videos met all specifications.
4. ### Creation of Videos for All Activities:

   Using the approved design solutions, I developed videos for other sports activities, including soccer, tennis, and golf. These were finalized with input from marketers and the client, ensuring consistency across all sports.
5. ### Preparing the Videos for Launch:

   I adapted the selected video concepts to different formats, initially developed in 1:1 and adapted to 9:16. The final videos were delivered for launching the advertising campaigns.

## Challenges

Working with a large-scale client like USSC for the first time, it was crucial to demonstrate high results and a professional approach. Flexibility and iterative feedback were key to overcoming these challenges.

## Result

The campaign successfully launched on Facebook, increasing USSC's brand awareness and engagement. The visually appealing and dynamic videos attracted attention, stimulated user interaction, and significantly boosted camp registrations.
