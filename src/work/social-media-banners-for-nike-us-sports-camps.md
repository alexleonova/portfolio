## Overview:

US Sports Camps (USSC) is a leading organizer of sports camps in the USA and worldwide, and an exclusive partner of Nike. As their Social Media Designer, I was tasked with creating advertising creatives for their Facebook and Instagram campaigns.

## Problem:

USSC needed a creative advertising strategy to attract new customers and scale advertising budgets without losing effectiveness. They had not previously utilized Facebook for marketing and required a fresh approach to engage their target audience across multiple sports and camp types.

## Solution:

I developed a comprehensive set of visually appealing and brand-consistent advertising creatives for 18 different sports/activities, with multiple design options for each. These creatives were designed to increase engagement, drive website traffic, and ultimately boost camp bookings.

\[DEMO]

## Design Process:

1. ### Research and Analysis:

   I began by defining the goals for the creatives, which needed to complement ad content while being attention-grabbing and stylish. I studied competitors' creatives, analyzed USSC's website for design cues, and collected references from platforms like Dribbble and Behance. I also collaborated with copywriters and marketers to align on content strategy.
2. ### Concept Development:

   Using basketball camps as an example, I created six alternative design concepts. I focused on selecting an appropriate color scheme, typography, and adapting client photos. My designs were grounded in general design principles, research findings, and client preferences. This stage was crucial in establishing a strong foundation for the entire campaign.
3. ### Refinement and Approval:

   I presented the design concepts to the marketing team for discussion and refinement. We selected four main solutions to present to the client. After receiving client approval, I made minimal content edits to finalize the designs. This collaborative approach ensured that the final designs met both marketing objectives and client expectations.
4. ### Full Campaign Creation:

   With the approved design framework, I developed creatives for the remaining 17 sports activities (soccer, tennis, swimming, etc.). Each set was tailored to the specific sport while maintaining brand consistency. I worked closely with marketers on content and obtained final client approval on design aspects.
5. ### Preparation for Launch:

   I adapted the selected creative concepts for various formats (1:1 and 9:16 ratios) to ensure compatibility across different social media platforms. The final step involved handing over the ready-to-use creatives to the team responsible for launching the advertising campaigns.

## Challenges:

* Creating visually distinct designs for 18 different sports while maintaining brand consistency
* Balancing information density with visual appeal in limited ad space
* Adapting designs for multiple social media formats
* Meeting high expectations for my first large-scale client project

## Result:

The project resulted in a comprehensive set of advertising creatives that effectively showcased USSC's diverse range of sports camps. 

### The designs successfully:

* Increased website traffic and potential customer engagement
* Strengthened USSC's brand image as a professional sports camp organizer
* Improved booking rates, particularly for camps that previously struggled to attract applicants
* Enabled USSC to scale their advertising efforts across multiple platforms

This project not only met the client's objectives but also enhanced my skills in brand-consistent design, social media advertising, and large-scale campaign creation. It demonstrated the power of well-executed visual design in driving marketing success and provided a valuable case study for future client work.
