## Overview:

Logiq, a provider of innovative marketing solutions for small to medium-sized agencies, sought to revamp its main website page. As the UX/UI designer, I was tasked with updating the page structure, refreshing the content, and modernizing the design while preserving their corporate identity.

## Problem:

Logiq's existing homepage could not effectively showcase its ability to provide cutting-edge ways to engage and influence consumers. The client needed a fresh online presence to better reflect their vision and address current business challenges in the competitive marketing software industry.

## Solution:

I delivered a comprehensive redesign of the homepage that retained Logiqâ€™s corporate identity while incorporating modern UX/UI design principles. The new design aimed to solve business challenges by providing an intuitive and engaging user experience.

\[DEMO]

## Design Process:

1. ### Research and Analysis:

   I began with a comprehensive research phase, analyzing Logiq's current website to identify existing design principles and page structure. I also conducted competitor research to determine optimal block placement and content organization for the new page.
2. ### Prototyping:

   Using insights from my research, I developed low-fidelity wireframes to establish the new page structure. I focused on improving navigation and creating logical content groupings that would guide users through Logiq's offerings more effectively.
3. ### UI Design:

   For the UI design phase, I created high-fidelity prototypes that balanced Logiq's established brand with modern design elements. I carefully selected color schemes, typography, and visual elements that would refresh the look while maintaining brand consistency. Throughout this process, I applied key design principles such as visibility, familiarity, and unity.
4. ### Handoff to Development:

   To ensure a smooth transition, I created a comprehensive design system and detailed the functionality of interactive elements. I also adapted the design for tablet and mobile views to ensure a responsive experience across devices.

## Challenges:

The primary challenge was adapting to changes in page structure and content volume during the design process. This required flexibility and rapid iterations to incorporate new requirements while maintaining visual coherence and design integrity.

## Result:

The redesign of Logiq's homepage was successfully completed, integrating their existing corporate identity with an updated, user-friendly design. This solution not only met Logiq's business objectives but also enhanced user engagement. The positive client feedback and recommendations significantly boosted my company's market reputation.
