## Overview

Raqeem Bank is a mobile banking application designed specifically for the Middle Eastern market. The project aimed to create a secure, intuitive, and culturally relevant banking experience that reflects regional user behavior, language specifics, and visual preferences.

## Problem

The main challenge of the project was designing a trustworthy and easy-to-use mobile banking experience from the ground up. Without an existing product, all visual, interaction, and behavioral patterns had to be defined from scratch, while ensuring the interface remained clear, accessible, and secure.\
\
At the same time, the application needed to reflect the cultural and linguistic specifics of the Middle Eastern market, support localization, and balance complex financial functionality with simplicity and ease of use. Achieving consistency across screens and flows was critical to building user trust and reducing cognitive load in everyday financial interactions.

## Solution

The solution was a comprehensive mobile banking experience built around clarity, consistency, and trust. Key outcomes included:

* A scalable mobile design system supporting multiple languages and color themes
* Optimized and secure user flows for everyday banking tasks
* Interactive dashboards providing quick access to key financial information
* Strong focus on localization, accessibility, and cultural adaptation

## Design Process

1. ### Discovery:

   Understanding the product goals, regional context, and user expectations for mobile banking in the Middle Eastern market. This phase helped me define functional priorities and experience principles.
2. ### UX Design:

   I created user flows and wireframes to map core banking scenarios such as onboarding, transactions, and account management. Wireframes helped us define screen structure and content hierarchy, visualize user journeys end-to-end, and validate navigation logic before visual design.
3. ### UI Design:

   The UI design phase focused on creating a visually cohesive and highly usable mobile interface that communicates trust and clarity. I designed each screen with attention to hierarchy, spacing, typography, and alignment to ensure that key information and actions are immediately clear.\
   \
   Alongside screen design, I created a scalable mobile design system to ensure consistency across the product. Core components were designed with multiple states and interaction behaviors, supporting localization and multiple color themes. I provided documentation for all components and usage guidelines in Zeroheight, with a clear and structured reference for both design and development teams, ensuring smooth implementation and future scalability.
4. ### Prototyping:

   I built interactive prototypes to validate flows, transitions, and key interactions before development, ensuring the product felt intuitive and reliable.
5. ### Handoff to Development:

   The final designs were prepared for smooth implementation by the development team. This included a fully documented design system, detailed component states, responsive behaviors, and interaction guidelines.\
   \
   I delivered all screens and components in a developer-ready format, ensuring design consistency during implementation and reducing friction between design and development.

## Key Achievements

* 60+ Component Design System. Expanded and documented a scalable component library with multi-language and multi-theme support.
* 10+ Optimized User Flows. Designed and improved core banking journeys tailored to the Middle Eastern market.
* 35+ Mobile Banking Screens. Delivered modern banking interfaces with improved hierarchy, accessibility, and usability.

## Result:

Raqeem Bank launched with a solid design foundation that supports secure transactions, clear financial communication, and future scalability. The product delivers a trustworthy, intuitive, and culturally adapted mobile banking experience, ready for long-term growth.\

For me, it was an incredible experience and a great opportunity to work on a full-fledged banking application and design system. It was also a chance to work with a team of professionals, whose communication was productive and educational.
