## Overview:

NBC Camps is a provider of training camps for basketball, volleyball, lacrosse, and fine arts, focusing on athletic skill development and personal growth. As a motion designer, I was tasked with creating engaging video content for their social media advertising campaigns.

## Problem:

NBC Camps needed to boost registrations for their basketball and volleyball camps. They required professionally created visual materials for Facebook and Instagram ads to increase the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and attract their target audience's attention.

## Solution:

I developed a series of over 10 promotional videos for basketball and volleyball camps, designed to be visually appealing and aligned with NBC Camps' brand identity. These videos were created to increase brand awareness, draw attention to their camps, and drive more registrations through social media advertising.

\[DEMO]

## Design Process:

1. ### Research and Analysis:

   I began by defining the goals for the videos, which needed to complement the ad content while being noticeable and eye-catching. I researched the target audience (parents planning their children's activities) and explored creative solutions in the industry. I also collaborated with the copywriter and marketer to discuss video content.
2. ### Concept Development:

   I created three alternative concepts for the final video fragment (5-10 seconds each). This involved selecting typography, creating animation effects, adapting the client's existing video materials, and applying motion design principles. I also sourced and purchased suitable music to complement the video content.
3. ### Collaboration and Refinement:

   I presented the design concepts to the marketing team and made necessary adjustments based on their feedback. After receiving client approval, I made minimal content edits to finalize the videos.
4. ### Expansion and Adaptation:

   Using the approved design solutions, I developed creatives for volleyball camps. I then adapted the selected video concepts to different formats, originally creating them in a 1:1 format and later adapting them to 9:16 for various social media platforms.

## Challenges:

* Balancing information and entertainment in short-form videos
* Ensuring brand consistency across multiple video creatives
* Adapting designs for different social media formats
* Meeting tight deadlines while maintaining high-quality output

## Result:

The final product was a set of visually appealing and professionally designed promotional videos that strengthened NBC Camps' brand image. These videos helped increase brand awareness, drew more attention to their camps, and drove more registrations. 

The success of the Facebook campaigns allowed NBC Camps to more effectively engage with potential customers and increase enrollment, particularly for camps that had previously struggled to attract applicants on other platforms.
